            <div class="textbox">
                <p> Ka the Creator was said to ride a chariot of lightning across the sky when he created Erthos.  He created all life and left behind his children "The Godlings" to watch over us with the promise of Ka's return. <br><br> Every Millenia, however, the Godlings power becomes too much for them to contain and raw creational power drips from them and touches the mortal world.  <br><br>One man known simply as the Castor acquired this raw power and forged the Paragon, a mighty weapon that scares even The Godlings.  It's power so immense it was broken into several pieces and scattered across the lands.<br><br> When the 5 become 1 the Gods will be undone! <br> This prophecy has echoed throughout the history of Erthos.  Many Heroes, Wanderers, and even Tyrants have tried to search for the weapon of legend, but to no avail.<br><br>  Only the Chosen Five will be able to weild the power of the Godlings.  </p>
